## Intro

I'm known for my creative problem-solving, innovative solutions, and thoughtful designs. Adept in High Performance Computing, Cloud Systems, Data-centre Architecture, and a host of Clinical, Genomics, BioInformatics applications and analysis pipelines. I love the Sciences and I'm Passionate about Open Source, using both as my principal philosophy for driving secure and socially beneficial changes in the workplace and even at home. I fully believe that it's their collaborative aspects that drive innovation and efficiency in all aspects of IT operations. I am dedicated to my customers, and have the reputation to match.

In the words of Hanif Khalak, Ass. Dean of Scientific Computing, Weill Cornell Medicine, NYC:

"Greg is among the top technical professionals I know, and certainly one of the best I've worked with. I don't know that I've seen all he can do -- wherever he goes will be transformed by his choosing to be on board. A top performer, he is also a great team player with an intense focus on the customer. His involvement and contributions are such that stakeholders and peers vye for his time. A genuine pleasure to work with Greg and have him on my team."

EG:..    All I can say is, the best way to get a good honest review on my skills, what I am like to work with as a collaborator, peer, team leader and even a subordinate, is to talk to my references.

## Education

I am mostly self-taught, I had 2 to 3 consecutive jobs whilst still in school. From Grade 8 to 12, I went pretty much straight from school to work, so subsequently my school work suffered as a result.  Still, I spend a lot of time learning. I’ve always been an obsessive reader, and rather enjoy studying. I’d have probably still been in University if I’d had the means when I was young.  I have completed a fair amount of industry training and have a number of certifications.

###### A valuable learning experience:

We (the techs), spent many an evening, working totally alone, in a huge warehouse data-centre in a very bad neighbourhood in Slough, West London; surrounded by around 10000 servers, doing new deployments as well as being the Bastions of Rackspaces “Fanatical Support”, a mantra, we experienced as a noose around our necks. Our performance baseline being: “Any call must be answered by a human within 3 rings”. A daunting, anxiety ridden, near impossible promise, that created much conflict between engineers and operational management. This,  coupled with a bizarre, rotational shift schedule (on: 3 nights 12 hours, off: 2 days off, on:2 days 8 hours, off: 3 days, on: 2 nights 12 hours, back-to-back with 2 days 12 hours), meant that we experienced a frighteningly fast turnover rate for new employees, and making me understand why they had a perpetual probation policy which kept staff off the books as permanent, until probation was arbitrarily deemed complete.  I was always tired, my relationship was on the rocks and my attempts to stand up for the rights of my teammates and mine, ensured that I would never get out of probation; no matter how I performed. It’s safe to say, I’ve been intolerant of such abuse since, and happy to say that not too long after I and a slew of other top techs left, drove Rackspace to move from the worst place to work at, to one of the best.

This is actually such a significant place for me. I had never even touched a computer before starting here. Initially, the Owners, Ken and Gordon, hired me as a paid apprentice on less money I had earned in my previous jobs as a Tiler and Carpenter. I was basically told, “We will pay 1000 Rand a month. If, in 3 months' time, you suck, you should return to your prior labour. If, however, you are decent, we will pay you a lot better and make you permanent”. So, I really started from the absolute bottom, and took to computers like a duck to water, and very quickly rose in the ranks. Ken and Gordon, kept their promise, they made me permanent, and raised my salary to 5k.  
This company was, and still is, the developer of Unisolv, the most popular and widely deployed pharmaceutical retail software in South Africa. Amazingly, to this day, it is still actively developed using Cobol 85 on Linux and Windows. The very first machine I touched was an Intel 286 that I had to put together, using a manual I barely understood. The first OS I learnt was SCO/Microsoft Xenix. I first built pcs, next: deployed them at customers, initially just installation, but within a few weeks, provided training for this new digital MIMS as well; soon after, I was deploying our entire offering for small to large customer; everything from Servers, to terminals, archives, multihomed site muxing and data-warehousing.

I eventually got tired of driving 100k every year, so I moved to the Helpdesk. I was a tireless and enthusiastic phone support nerd, so it didn't take long till I was running the Helpdesk too. Eventually, I needed to get back out again, I had sores on my ears from spending days on 8 hour calls, helping tech inept Pharmacist Assistants reinstall and restore entire systems supported by me on the opposite end, armed with a 9600 baud rate connection, uucp, rz/sz and gopher; a necessity driven by the minimum 12 hour journey separating them and the closest tech. My time to leave was soon approaching, I had served my final year as the Software Manager, where I planned and managed customer feature development in the software. I loved this place, I had served in every technical role the company had, so, I left the only way I would have, for a girl.

## Major Projects

### Icon Oncology, Cape Town *- Linux Systems Administrator*
##### 2022-08 - 2023-07

- Create a long term plan for the uncertain future of the CentOS based Linux systems and also to start deploying a technology stack and procedures that can begin to align the development and deployment process in line with modern DevOps Practices.

##### Genomics in the Cloud (AWS/EC2)
###### 2020-01 – 2020-09

* Collaborative Project with Amazon Team (NYC) and Weill Cornell Medicine (NYC).  
* POC: Test the feasibility and cost of running various HPC workloads in the cloud.

**Technology Stack:** AWS EC2, AWS S3, Docker, CWL, anaconda/bioconda, Terraform and cloudformation

#####  Modernise HPC Infrastructure
###### 2014-01 – 2017-08

* Minimise toolset and standardise OS using a single universal base image.  
* Simplify node management and enhance their role flexibility. 

###### Summary:

This was a large and complex project. I had started on my own, but was thankfully joined by Sam a year into it. Sam brought with him the idea of running the entire Slurm cluster inside docker. Simplifying the code base and allowing us to elegantly deploy Slurm clusters the same way we deployed any other web app, as well as enabling management of our HPC workloads using our standard docker toolset.

###### Challenges:

* With nearly every series of Mellanox ConnectX Infiniband Adaptor ever produced. (ConnectX2, ConnectX3,ConnectX3-Pro,ConnectX4 and ConnectX-5), I had to create code to compile custom kernels for 6 different HW types.  
* Slurm did not play well with the dynamic naming so common with containers. Getting Slurm to work inside Docker was no joke, mainly because so much of its configuration had to be hardcoded at the time. A mammoth scripting challenge, which we both ultimately enjoyed.

##### 

##### DIaaS4R- Dynamic Infrastructure-as-a-Service for Research

###### 2011-09 - 2013-01

Reduce Cost and Time needed for Research teams to acquire IT resources for Grant funded research.

* Build Internal S/IaaS Cloud for Self Service Deployment of Scientific Applications.

* oVirt KVM + IBM GPFS Filesystem on DDN GridSCaler Storage

* Deployment and Orchestration using images, Cobbler and Puppet.

* Code, Bug and Task management using Redmine and Git

* Pre-defined templates for common project apps, such as, Wiki, Git, R/Perl/Ruby and Python(BioConda), Fileshare, Latex Publishing, Forum, Q&A and Project Management.

###### Summary

This system drastically reduced the time and cost associated with IT resource procurement and deployment. Users could now deploy their servers and apps on-the-fly and almost instantly. A significant benefit for financially thin and time constrained projects funded with  Research Grant money.

##### HPC Farm for Biomedical Research in Genetics

###### 2012-01 - 2012-09

Build HPC CPU/GPU Compute Cluster and configure it for Parallel computing.

* 20 Servers, 5TB RAM, 448 (896 Logical) Intel Sandy-Bridge Cores92 CUDA® parallel processing cores (Nvidia Tesla 2090)

* 5 Massive Memory Servers (512GB Each) for Gene Analysis

* 1.2 PB of Storage in Single GPFS Parallel FS (Scalable to 20PB)

* High Throughput SMB/Webdav/NFS/SSHFS Fileshare

* Mellanox 40GBps QDR Infiniband storage and MPI interconnect

**Toolset**: BrightComputing Cluster Manager (BM Provisioning and Monitoring), slurm/globusftp/mpich2/openmpi, Authentication, rights and fileshare (MS-AD and SSSD RFC2307 Schema, samba4, NFS-Ganesha and nginx clustered and balanced with CTDB), HPC Batch (Slurm, openmpi/mpich2, globus gridftp), App compilation, Toolchaining (anaconda/bioconda, environment-modules, EasyBuild, Intel C Compiler Suite <icc>)

###### Challenges

* Refactoring our code to be compatible with Slurm and the toolchains.  
* Communicating and getting consensus for some very long outage windows.  
* Practically zero experience with GPFS File System. SGE/UGE, Slurm and MPI  
* With such a steep learning curve, I ended up providing one-on-one training for almost 30 people, after I had just learnt it by myself.
